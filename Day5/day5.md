🚀 **Day 5: Deep Dive into C Operators!**

Hello Everyone! 👋

Day 5 of my 30 Days of C programming challenge has been an exhilarating journey into the realm of operators. 🌐

### Key Learnings:

1. **Arithmetic Operators:**
   - Mastered the use of `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` for performing basic arithmetic operations.

2. **Relational Operators:**
   - Explored relational operators like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` for making comparisons in conditional statements.

3. **Logical Operators:**
   - Delved into logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) for combining conditions and making decisions in complex scenarios.

4. **Bitwise Operators:**
   - Unveiled the power of bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for manipulating individual bits in data.

5. **Assignment Operators:**
   - Perfected the use of assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`) for efficient variable assignments.

6. **Ternary Operator (`? :`):**
   - Explored the concise `? :` ternary operator for conditional expressions, providing a shorthand for simple if-else statements.

7. **`sizeof` Operator:**
   - Learned about the `sizeof` operator, a powerful tool to determine the size, in bytes, of a data type or object.

### Code Snippet - Using Ternary Operator and `sizeof`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 2;

    // Ternary operator
    int max = (a > b) ? a : b;

    // sizeof operator
    printf("Size of int: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(int));
    printf("Size of char: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(char));

    return 0;
}
```

### Reflecting on the Journey:

Day 5 was all about mastering the tools for data manipulation in C. Excited to apply these operators, including the ternary operator and `sizeof`, in crafting efficient and dynamic programs! 💻💡
