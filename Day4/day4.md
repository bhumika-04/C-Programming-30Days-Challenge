### Day 4: Foundations of C Programming

#### Topics Covered:
1. **Keywords and Identifiers:**
   - Explored the importance of keywords and the art of creating meaningful identifiers.

2. **Tokens and Their Types:**
   - Discovered the building blocks of C programming â€” tokens, each serving a specific purpose in the language.

3. **Variables and Scope Rules:**
   - Mastered the concept of variables, their declaration, and the rules governing their scope within a program.

4. **Size of Data Types:**
   - Explored the memory allocation for different data types, understanding the importance of efficient memory usage.

5. **Constants in C:**
   - Delved into the use of constants, providing a stable and unchanging value in the code.

6. **Typecasting:**
   - Unraveled the art of typecasting, converting data from one type to another to meet the program's requirements.

#### Code Snippet - Size of Data Types:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Size of int: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(int));
    printf("Size of float: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(float));
    printf("Size of double: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(double));
    printf("Size of char: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(char));

    return 0;
}
```

### Reflecting on the Day:
Day 4 was a deep dive into the fundamentals of C programming, laying a robust foundation for future endeavors. Understanding the intricacies of keywords, identifiers, tokens, and more has opened up exciting possibilities for building efficient and scalable programs.
