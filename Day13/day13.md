🚀 **Day 13: Harnessing the Power of Library Functions in C!**

Hello Everyone! 👋

On Day 13 of my 30 Days of C programming challenge, I delved into the realm of library functions, unlocking the potential of pre-built functions to streamline and enhance my code. 🌐

### Key Learnings:

1. **Understanding Library Functions:**
   - Explored the concept of library functions, recognizing their significance in C programming for performing common tasks.

2. **Standard Library Functions:**
   - Dived into standard library functions, including those from `stdio.h` and `stdlib.h`, understanding their applications in input/output and memory management.

3. **String Handling Functions:**
   - Explored string handling functions from `string.h`, such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `strcmp`, streamlining string operations.

4. **Math Library Functions:**
   - Leveraged math library functions from `math.h` for mathematical computations, including `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, and more.

### Code Snippet - Harnessing Library Functions:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    // Example of using standard library functions
    printf("Hello, World!\n");

    // Example of using string handling functions
    char source[] = "Hello";
    char destination[20];
    strcpy(destination, source);
    printf("Copied String: %s\n", destination);

    // Example of using math library functions
    double squareRoot = sqrt(25);
    printf("Square root of 25: %.2f\n", squareRoot);

    // Example of using a custom library function
    int result = addNumbers(5, 7);
    printf("Result of addition: %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}

// Custom library function
int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Reflecting on the Journey:

Day 13 was a deep dive into library functions, unlocking a wealth of pre-built tools to enhance the efficiency and functionality of my C programs. Excited to leverage these resources in future projects! 💻💡
