🚀 **Day 7: Navigating Decision Making and Loops in C!**

Hello Everyone! 👋

Today, on Day 7 of my 30 Days of C programming challenge, I delved into the realms of decision-making, loops, and recursion. 🌐

### Key Learnings:

1. **`if` Statements:**
   - Explored the foundational `if` statement, mastering the art of making decisions based on a single condition.

2. **`if-else` Statements:**
   - Dived into `if-else` statements, allowing for alternative paths based on the truthiness of a condition.

3. **`nested if` Statements:**
   - Delved into the power of nested `if` statements, handling complex decision-making scenarios.

4. **`switch` Statements:**
   - Mastered the usage of `switch` statements for efficient handling of multiple conditions.

5. **`do-while` and `for` Loops:**
   - Explored the versatility of loops, using `do-while` and `for` loops for repetitive tasks with different structures.

6. **`goto` Statement:**
   - Understood the controversial `goto` statement, acknowledging its role in structured programming and its cautious usage.

7. **Recursion:**
   - Embraced recursion, a powerful technique in which a function calls itself, offering elegant solutions to certain programming problems.

### Code Snippet - Using Loops and Recursion:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Example of a recursive function to calculate factorial
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;

    // Example of a for loop
    for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
    printf("\n");

    // Example of a do-while loop
    int counter = 1;
    do {
        printf("Counter: %d\n", counter);
        counter++;
    } while (counter <= 3);

    // Example of a goto statement
    if (num > 0) {
        goto positive;
    } else {
        goto non_positive;
    }

    positive:
        printf("The number is positive.\n");
        goto end;

    non_positive:
        printf("The number is non-positive.\n");

    end:

    // Example of recursion
    printf("Factorial of %d is: %d\n", num, factorial(num));

    return 0;
}
```

### Reflecting on the Journey:

Day 7 has been a comprehensive exploration of decision-making structures, loops, and recursion in C. The versatility of these constructs is exciting, and I'm eager to implement them in more complex projects! 💻💡
